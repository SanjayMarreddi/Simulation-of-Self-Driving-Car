# Simulation-of-Self-Driving-Car
A self driving car is a type of vehicle that does not need a person to operate it. Instead, it uses advanced sensory technology like lidar, sonar, GPS, radar, or odometry and inertial measurements to identify environmental changes and adapt to restore safe speed or distance. This project mostly aims to achieve road safety (human error is the cause of 90% of road accidents) and less traffic on the road among other things. Vehicles may be able to communicate with each other to share information and help prevent clogged roads.
